## Description

Firework provides:

* Realtime Web Dashboard
* Logging API - REST with Json Body

Log items include properties such as:

* actor (who)
* action (what)
* amount
* units
* date and time.

Once log items have been added you can browse the real-time timeline to see what happened when.

Items can be added via the inbound rest API or manually through the dashboard.

Integration to online services such as [Zapier](https://zapier.com) enable realtime logging of hundreds of upstream devices and applications.

For comprehensive instructions visit the [documentation and support](http://docs.firework.com) website.

Firework can be deployed on Linux, OS X, and Windows operating systems.

Firework requires [Meteor v1.2](https://www.meteor.com) which in turn uses [MongoDb](http://www.mongodb.com) and [Node JS](https://nodejs.org).
