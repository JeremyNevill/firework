Firework
========

Firework is a [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com) version of the Firework Micrologging Platform.

Micrologging is what we're calling..

'concise log items that mean something, can be can be read by humans, and parsed by computers.'

Firework enables you to record the things you have done, like a to-done list,
from any device that can handle a modern Meteor web interface.

Log items that you have added include such attributes as
actor(who), action(what), amount, units, date and time.

Once you start adding items you can browse your timeline by attribute and answer
questions such as 'how many miles have I ran this year?' or 'when did I last have a burrito?'
